Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require intermediate providers that offer the capability to transmit voice communications and signaling information from one destination to another, and that charge a rate to any other entity (including an affiliated entity) for such a transmission, to: (1) register with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and (2) comply with service quality standards to be established by the FCC.  An \"intermediate provider\" is an entity that: (1) enters a business arrangement with a long-distance voice service provider that makes the initial call path choice for more than 100,000 domestic retail subscriber lines, or with another intermediate provider, to carry, route, or transmit voice traffic from a call placed from or to an end user connection using a North American Numbering Plan resource; and (2) does not itself (directly or in conjunction with an affiliate) serve as such a long-distance initial call path choice provider in the context of originating or terminating a given call.  The bill prohibits such long-distance providers (including local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, commercial mobile radio services, interconnected voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP] services, and certain non-interconnected VoIP services) from using an intermediate provider to transmit voice communications and signals unless the intermediate provider is so registered.  The FCC must: (1) ensure the integrity of the transmission of voice communications to all customers in the United States, (2) prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such voice communications, and (3) make a registry of intermediate providers publicly available on the FCC website.  The bill shall not be construed to preempt or expand the authority of a state agency or public utility commission to collect data, or enforce state law and regulations, regarding the completion of intrastate voice communications.  Certain long-distance providers that make initial call path choices are exempt from service quality standards that the FCC is required to establish under this bill if they certify under a safe harbor provision in existing FCC rules that they monitor the performance of, or do not use, intermediate providers.

DIVISION B--FURTHER EXTENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018  Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to most federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law).  It prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing continuing resolution expires because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted.  The division also: (1) authorizes the Department of Energy to drawdown and sell specified crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in FY2018; and (2) makes additional funding available for the 2020 Decennial Census Program, the Southeastern Power Administration, and juror fees.  The division provides emergency funding for the Small Business Administration Disaster Loans Program Account. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)  DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018  This division provides appropriations to the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2018.  DIVISION D--MISCELLANEOUS  This division amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the Department of Agriculture Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) through FY2019. (EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for agricultural producers and land owners to implement certain conservation practices.)  DIVISION E--TAX MATTERS  This division amends the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 to repeal the 8% increase in the amount of the required installment of corporate estimated tax otherwise due in July, August, or September of 2020. It also increases the next required installment to reflect the amount of the decrease due to this division.  DIVISION F--HEALTH PROVISIONS  Strengthening and Underpinning the Safety-net to Aid Individuals Needing Care Act of 2018 or the SUSTAIN Care Act of 2018 This division extends and otherwise revises various Medicare programs and payment rules, including:    the Medicare-dependent hospital program;   the Independence at Home Demonstration Program;   certain outreach and counseling programs; and   specified payment rules related to certain low-volume hospitals, home health-care services, and misvalued services.   Additionally, the division modifies Medicare provisions related to supervision requirements, home-health claims, intensive cardiac-rehabilitation programs, telehealth, accountable care organizations, medical records, accreditation, physician self-referral, speech-generating devices, fraud and abuse, coverage of certain testing services, hospital transfers to hospice, ambulance transports, certain outpatient therapy services, long-term care hospital payments, and biosimilar products.  With respect to Medicare Advantage, the division:    reauthorizes and otherwise revises special-needs plans;   expands testing of the Value-Based Insurance Design Model; and   modifies provisions related to supplemental benefits, telehealth, and quality ratings.   With respect to Medicaid, the bill modifies provisions related to third-party liability, lump-sum income, and disproportionate-share hospital payments.  The division reduces annual funding available to the Medicare Improvement Fund and the Medicaid Improvement Fund and modifies the amount of annual funding available to the Prevention and Public Health Fund.  The division also extends specified public health programs.  In addition, the division establishes or revises various reporting requirements for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, certain suppliers of ground ambulance services, and the Government Accountability Office.  Family First Prevention Services Act  The division modifies various provisions related to foster care and adoption. Specifically, the division:    revises funding and eligibility requirements with respect to foster-care prevention services and programs; limits federal funding for placements that are not in foster-family homes;   provides for grants to support the recruitment and retention of high-quality foster families;   provides for social-impact partnerships;   extends and otherwise revises various other programs; and   modifies provisions related to foster-care maintenance payments, evidence-based kinship navigator programs, family-reunification services, interstate case processing, regional-partnership grants, qualified residential-treatment programs, records checks, adoption assistance, child-support enforcement, and prison-data reporting.   DIVISION G--BUDGETARY EFFECTS  This division exempts the budgetary effects of division D and each succeeding division of this bill from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules and certain budget scorekeeping guidelines.
